5 Stages of Grief


You may want to get back at your ex-boss, or ex-company. You may be tempted to write an email to your skip-level manager, to HR, anonymously to a forum or maybe to the press. My advice? Don't. Let by-gones be by-gones. You have limited energy and limited time. You have a responsibility to yourself (and your family) to channel your energy to what will help you most: finding a job. And with a little bit of luck, a **better** job.

It bears repeating: your time is limited. As soon as you lose your job, the clock starts ticking. Unless you already have a job offer in their pocket, your new job starts right now:
1. Finding a job is your new FULL-TIME job.

You need to get up early in the morning. You need to build your resume. Iterate over it as needed. Publish it. Again and again. Connect with individuals in your network. Locate recruiters on LinkedIn. Message friends. Research companies. Explore opportunities. Go to meetups. Apply to positions. Keep up with email - respond to recruiters. 

## What are your priorities?
1. Communicate with your significant other
   1. Discuss your circumstances
   2. Be patient with each other
   3. Make a plan
2. Create your resum√©.
3. Get your finances in order. 
4. Be prepared for the road ahead.

# Create your Resume

Your resume is your sales agent, working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Any sales agent is better than none.


[Rudyard Kipling: If--](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---)


# Talking to Recruiters

Be prepared to reveal what your expectations for compensation are. For a full-time job, this is the base salary. For a contract job, have two numbers available: One for "W2", one for 1099.

In the state of California, it's illegal for a recruiter to ask you how much you were making. You can volunteer this information without being asked, but it's better to talk in terms of ranges.

# Networking
Always accept connection requests from recruiters.

How to find recruiters on LinkedIn:


LinkedIn
Slack
Facebook
Email (if you have time)
