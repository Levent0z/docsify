# Design Patterns

> Not a full list

## 1. Singleton Pattern

"There can be a single instance of a class"

Pro: It's just there
Con: Once established, hard to back out

## 2. Facade Pattern

Pro: Expose what your customer uses in an interface, hiding some of the complexities
Con: Too much specialization

## 3. Bridge/Adapter Pattern

Define an abstract interface for concrete implementations, i.e. an abstraction decoupled from implementations.

## 4. Strategy Pattern

Define strategies for different purposes to simplify complexity. Should have default strategies.

## 5. Observer Pattern (Pub/Sub)

Loose coupling between the publisher(s) and subscriber(s)

Con: Too many messages could be difficult to debug
