## Step 1: Understand the problem and establish design scope

2. Understand the requirements (based on DAU)

Questions to ask:
1. What are the features?

3. How fast will the company scale up?
4. What is the tech-stack, existing services?

## Step 2: Propose high-level design and get buy-in
1. Communicate your thoughts
2. Suggest multiple approaches if possible
3. Give high-level design first and then drill down.

## Step 3: Design deep dive
1. Design the most critical components first
2. Bounce ideas off the interviewer
3. NEVER GIVE UP. Ask for hints, and feedback early and often.

## Step 4: Wrap Up
1. Give a recap
2. Discuss error cases
3. Discuss operational issues (monitoring, rollout, ...)
4. How to scale up further?
5. NOT DONE until interview says you're done.
