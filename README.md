# Welcome

Check out a few of my public projects below or select a blog entry from the sidebar.

- [Saveman](https://www.saveman.app/) - A word game that runs in the browser using SVG and CSS animations. A hobby project I rewrote on the app during covid lockdowns. It's true to the original from the Windows Phone days. 
- [o11y-sample-app](https://o11y-sample-app.herokuapp.com/) - A fullstack LWC ([Lightning Web Components](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc)) application running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) I built as part of my day job.
